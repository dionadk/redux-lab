## Part I: Redux Shopping Cart

Incorporating Redux into your React App can be a challenging process so it's important to take time to understand how the code works. Go through the [Shopping Cart](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/react-redux-shopping-cart) walkthrough.

## Part II: Redux Todo App

Once you have completed the Shopping Cart walkthrough, use the same methodology to create a Todo app (i.e., an app that maintains a todo list).

Your MVP should be to create a todo app that functions exactly like shopping cart. We encourage you, however, once you reach the MVP to implement one or more of the following...

- The user should be able to create a new todo
- The user should be able to update existing todos
- The user should be able to see two lists: one of incomplete todos and one of complete todos
- The user should be able to fully delete a todo from the application
